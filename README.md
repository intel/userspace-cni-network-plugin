# Userspace CNI Plugin
The Userspace CNI is a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin designed to
implement userspace networking (as opposed to kernel space networking), like
DPDK based applications. It is designed to run with either OVS-DPDK or VPP along
with the [Multus CNI plugin](https://github.com/intel/multus-cni) in Kubernetes
for Bare metal container deployment model. It enhances high performance
container Networking solution and Dataplane Acceleration for NFV Environment.

Userspace networking requires additional considerations. For one, the interface
needs to be created/configured on a local vswitch (running on the host). There
may also be a desire to add the interface to a specfic network on the host
through the local vswitch. Second, when the interface is inserted into the
container, it is not owned by the kernel, so additional work needs to be done
in the container to consume the interface and add to a network within the
container. The Userspace CNI is designed to work with these additional
considerations by provisioning the local vswitch (OVS-DPDK/VPP), and by pushing
data into the container so the interface can be consumed.

**NOTE:** One major design feature that needs to be further work is how the
data is pushed into the container and consumed by the container. Current code,
which is not the final solution, writes the data to a file, and the directory
the file is in is mounted in the countainer. Code in the container must know
where and how to parse this data. For VPP, the code in the container to handle
this is currently implemented in the vpp-app piece of code
(*./cnivpp/vpp-app/*). Because this solution is temporary, the OVS CNI Library
has not been modified to handle pushing data into the container.  

The Userspace CNI, based on the input config data, adds interfaces (memif and/or
vhost-user interfaces) to a local OVS-DPDK or VPP instance running on the host.
Then adds that interface to a local network, like an L2 Bridge. The Userspace CNI
then processes config data intended for the container and adds that data to a
Database the container can consume.

DPDK Vhostuser is new virtualization technology. Please refer to
[here](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/howto/virtio_user_for_container_networking.html)
for more information.

# Build & Clean

This plugin is recommended to be built with Go 1.9.4 and either OVS-DPDK 2.9.0-3
or VPP 18.04. Other versions of Go, OVS-DPDK and VPP are theoretically
supported, but MIGHT cause unknown issue.

There are a few environmental variables used in building and teating this plugin.
Here is an example:
```
   cat ~/.bashrc
   :
   export GOPATH=~/go
   export CNI_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/plugins/bin
```


The Userspace CNI requires several files from VPP in-order to build. If VPP
should be installed but is not installed, see [Installing VPP](#installing-vpp)
section below for instructions. If Userspace CNI is being built on a build
server or is using OVS-DPDK (i.e. - don't want VPP installed), then follow the
instructions below under
[Building VPP CNI Library with OVS](#building-vpp-cni-library-with-ovs).

To get and build the Userspace CNI plugin:
```
   cd $GOPATH/src/
   go get github.com/intel/vhost-user-net-plugin
   cd github.com/intel/vhost-user-net-plugin
   make
```

Once the binary is built, it needs to be copied to the CNI directory:
```
   cp userspace/userspace $CNI_PATH/.
```

To remove the binary and temporary files generated whild building the source
codes, perform a make clean:
```
   make clean
```


## Update dependencies in vendor/
This project is currently using **glide**. To refresh or update the set
dependancies for this project, run:
```
   glide update --strip-vendor
```
This project currently checks in the *glide.lock* and files under the
*vendor* directory.

configuration file.


# OVS CNI Library Intro
OVS CNI Library is written in GO and used by UserSpace CNI to interface with the
OVS. OVS currently does not have a GO-API, though there are some external
packages that are being explored. When the CNI is invoked, OVS CNI library calls
into a python script which builds up an OVS CLI command (ovs-vsctl) and executes
the request.

## Installing OVS
To install the DPDK-OVS, the source codes contains a
[document](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/Documentation/intro/install/dpdk.rst)
for how to install the DPDK-OVS.

## Running OVS CNI Library with OVS
The Userspace CNI plugin builds the OVS CNI Library from the cniovs
sub-folder. In order to run with the OVS CNI Library, the OVS python script
must be installed on the system. To install the script, run *make install*
as described in
[Building VPP CNI Library with OVS](#building-vpp-cni-library-with-ovs). 

## Configuring the System
DPDK-OVS is a DPDK based application, so some detailed system requirements can
be found at
[DPDK requirements](http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/sys_reqs.html).
Hugepages are the main requirement for the VHOST_USER virtual ports.
```
echo 'vm.nr_hugepages=2048' > /etc/sysctl.d/hugepages.conf
```
Or add the following configuration to the grub configuration:
```
default_hugepagesz=2m hugepagesz=2m hugepages=2048
```


# VPP CNI Library Intro
VPP CNI Library is written in GO and used by UserSpace CNI to interface with the
VPP GO-API. When the CNI is invoked, VPP CNI library opens a GO Channel to the
local VPP instance and passes gRPC messages between the two.

As mentioned above, to build the Userspace CNI, VPP needs to be installed, or
serveral VPP files to compile against. When VPP is installed, it copies it's
json API files to */usr/share/vpp/api/*. VPP CNI Libary uses these files to
compile against and generate the properly versioned messages to the local VPP
Instance. So to build the VPP CNI, VPP must be installed (or the proper json
files must be in */usr/share/vpp/api/*).


## Building VPP CNI Library with OVS
The Userspace CNI plugin builds the VPP CNI Library from the cnivpp
sub-folder. In order to run with the VPP CNI Library, VPP must be installed
on the system. If VPP should be installed but is not installed, see the
[Installing VPP](#installing-vpp) section below.

If the desire is to run the OVS CNI Library with OVS (i.e. - don't want
VPP installed), several files from a typical VPP install need to be on
the system to build. To install just these files and NOT VPP, run:
```
   cd $GOPATH/src/
   go get github.com/Billy99/user-space-net-plugin
   cd github.com/Billy99/user-space-net-plugin
   make install
```
This will install only the 5 or 6 files needed to build the VPP CNI Library.
This command also installs the OVS python script (see
[Running OVS CNI Library with OVS](#running-ovs-cni-library-with-ovs) for more details).
To remove these files, run:
```
   make clean
```
*make install* requires several packages to execute, primarily *wget*,
*cpio* and *rpm2cpio* on CentOS, and *binutils* on Ubuntu. If these packages are
not installed on your system, the following can be run to install the required
packages:
```
   make install-dep
```
**NOTE:** *make install* has been made to work for CentOS and Ubuntu based
systems. Other platforms will be made to work long term. If there is an
immediate need for other platforms, please open an issue to expedite the
feature (https://github.com/intel/vhost-user-net-plugin/issues).



## Installing VPP
There are several ways to install VPP. This code is based on a fixed release
VPP (VPP 18.04 initially), so it is best to install a released version (even
though it is possible to build your own).


### Prerequisites
Below are the VPP prerequisites:
* **Hugepages:** VPP requires 2M Hugepages. By default, VPP uses 1024
hugepages. If hugepages are not configured, on install VPP will allocate
them. This is primarily an issue if you are running in a VM that does not
already have hugepage backing, especially when you reboot the VM. If you
would like to change the number of hugepages VPP uses, after installing VPP,
edit */etc/sysctl.d/80-vpp.conf*. However, once VPP has been installed, the
default value has been applied. As an example, to reduce the number of
hugepages to 512, use:
```
   vm.nr_hugepages=512  
   vm.max_map_count=2048  
   kernel.shmmax=1073741824
```  
* **SELinux:** VPP works with SELinux enabled, but when running with
containers, work still needs to be done. Set SELinux to permissive.


### Install on CentOS
To install VPP on CentOS from NFV SIG:
```
sudo yum install centos-release-fdio
sudo yum install vpp*
```

OR - To install from the VPP Nexus Repo:
```
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/fdio-stable-1804.repo
[fdio-stable-1804]
name=fd.io stable/1804 branch latest merge
baseurl=https://nexus.fd.io/content/repositories/fd.io.stable.1804.centos7/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
   
sudo yum install vpp*
```

To start and enable VPP:
```
sudo systemctl start vpp
sudo systemctl enable vpp
```

### Install on Ubuntu
To install on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) as an example to demonstrate how to install VPP from pre-build packages:
```
export UBUNTU="xenial"
export RELEASE=".stable.18.04"
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/99fd.io.list
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://nexus.fd.io/content/repositories/fd.io$RELEASE.ubuntu.$UBUNTU.main/ ./" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/99fd.io.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vpp vpp-lib
```


### Install on Other Distros
For installing VPP on other distros, see:
https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/Installing_VPP_binaries_from_packages



# Testing

## Testing with VPP Docker Image and CNI

There are a few environmental variables used in this test. Here is an example:
```
   cat ~/.bashrc
   :
   export GOPATH=~/go
   export CNI_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/plugins/bin

```

In order to test, a container with VPP 18.04 and vpp-app has been created:
```
  docker pull bmcfall/vpp-centos-userspace-cni:latest
```
More details on the Docker Image, how to build from scratch and other
information, see
[README.md](https://github.com/intel/vhost-user-net-plugin/blob/master/cnivpp/docker/vpp-centos-userspace-cni/README.md)
in the '*./cnivpp/docker/vpp-centos-userspace-cni/*' subfolder.

Setup your configuration file in your CNI directory. An example is
*/etc/cni/net.d/*.

**NOTE:** The *userspace* nectconf definition is still a work in progress. So
the example below is just an example, see *usrsptypes* for latest definitions.

Example of how to setup a configuration for a VPP memif interface between the
host and container:
```
sudo vi /etc/cni/net.d/90-userspace.conf 
{
	"cniVersion": "0.3.1",
        "type": "userspace",
        "name": "memif-network",
        "ifName": "net0",
        "host": {
                "engine": "vpp",
                "iftype": "memif",
                "netType": "bridge",
                "memif": {
                        "role": "master",
                        "mode": "ethernet"
                },
                "bridge": {
                        "bridgeId": 4
                }
        },
        "container": {
                "engine": "vpp",
                "iftype": "memif",
                "netType": "interface",
                "memif": {
                        "role": "slave",
                        "mode": "ethernet"
                }
        },
        "ipam": {
                "type": "host-local",
                "subnet": "192.168.210.0/24",
                "routes": [
                        { "dst": "0.0.0.0/0" }
                ]
        }
}
```

To test, currently using a local script (copied from CNI scripts:
https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/master/scripts/docker-run.sh).
To run script:
```
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/intel/vhost-user-net-plugin/
   sudo CNI_PATH=$CNI_PATH GOPATH=$GOPATH ./scripts/vpp-docker-run.sh -it --privileged vpp-centos-userspace-cni
```

**NOTE:** The *vpp-docker-run.sh* script mounts some volumes in the container. Change as needed:
* *-v /var/run/vpp/cni/shared:/var/run/vpp/cni/shared:rw*
  * Default location in VPP to create sockets is */var/run/vpp/*. Socket files (memif or vhost-user)
are passed to the container through a subdirectory of this base directory..
* *-v /var/run/vpp/cni/$contid:/var/run/vpp/cni/data:rw*
  * Current implementation is to write the remote configuration into a file and share the directory
with the container, which is the volume mapping. Directory is currently hard coded.
* *--device=/dev/hugepages:/dev/hugepages*
  * VPP requires hugepages, so need to map hugepoages into container.

In the container, you should see the vpp-app ouput the message sequence of
its communication with local VPP (VPP in the container) and some database
dumps interleaved.

### Verify Host
To verify the local config (on host) in another window:

**Before Container Started:**
```
vppctl show interface
              Name               Idx       State          Counter          Count     
GigabitEthernet0/8/0              1        down      
GigabitEthernet0/9/0              2        down      
local0                            0        down      
   
vppctl show mode
l3 local0  
l3 GigabitEthernet0/8/0  
l3 GigabitEthernet0/9/0  
   
vppctl show memif
sockets
  id  listener    filename
  0   no          /run/vpp/memif.sock
```

After the container is started, on the host there should be an additional memif
interface created and added to a new L2 bridge, all created by the Userspace
CNI.

**After Container Started:**
```
vppctl show interface
              Name               Idx       State          Counter          Count
GigabitEthernet0/8/0              1        down

```

### Verify Container
The container is setup to start VPP, read the config pushed by the User Space
CNI, apply the data and then exit to bash. To verify the container config, in
the container, run the following:
```
vppctl show interface
              Name               Idx       State          Counter          Count     
local0                            0        down      
memif1/0                          1         up       
   
vppctl show interface addr
local0 (dn):
memif1/0 (up):
  L3 192.168.210.45/24
   
vppctl show mode

vppctl show memif

```

### Ping
If a second container is started on the same host, the two containers will have
L3 connectivity through an L2 bridge on the host. Because the interfaces in the
host are owned by VPP, use VPP in one of the containers to ping between the two
containers.
```
vppctl ping 192.168.210.46   
64 bytes from 192.168.210.46: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=39.0119 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.210.46: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=37.9991 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.210.46: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=57.0304 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.210.46: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=40.0044 ms
   
Statistics: 5 sent, 4 received, 20% packet loss
```

### Debug
The *vpp-centos-userspace-cni* container runs a script at startup (in Dockefile
CMD command) which starts VPP and then runs *vpp-app*. Assuming the same notes
above, to see what is happening in the container, cause
*vpp-centos-userspace-cni* container to start in bash and skip the script, then
run VPP and *vpp-app* manually: 
```
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/containernetworking/cni/scripts
   sudo CNI_PATH=$CNI_PATH GOPATH=$GOPATH ./scripts/vpp-docker-run.sh -it --privileged bmcfall/vpp-centos-userspace-cni:0.2.0 bash
   
   /* Within Container: */
   vpp -c /etc/vpp/startup.conf &
   vpp-app
```


## Testing with DPDK Testpmd Application

To follow this example you should have a system with kubernetes available and
configured to support native 1 GB hugepages. You should also have multus-cni and
vhost-user-net-plugin up and running. See `examples/crd-userspace-net-ovs-no-ipam.yaml` for
example config to use with multus. If using OVS,
check that you have bridge named `br0` in your OVS with `ovs-vsctl show` and if
not, create it with
`ovs-vsctl add-br br0 -- set bridge br0 datapath_type=netdev`.

### 1. Build the image to be used

Build container image from

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:bionic

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y dpdk;

ENTRYPOINT ["bash"]
```

Dockerfile and tag it as `ubuntu-dpdk`:

```bash
docker build . -t ubuntu-dpdk
```

### 2. Create pod with multiple vhostuser interfaces

Copy `get-prefix.sh` script from vhost-user-net-plugin repo to
`/var/lib/cni/vhostuser/`. See `examples/pod-multi-vhost.yaml`and start the
pod:

```bash
kubectl create -f examples/pod-multi-vhost.yaml
```

### 3. Open terminal to pod and start testpmd

Open terminal to the created pod once it is running:

```bash
kubectl exec -it multi-vhost-example bash
```

Launch testpmd and automatically start forwarding packets after sending first
burst:

```bash
# Get container ID
export ID=$(/vhu/get-prefix.sh)

# Run testpmd with ports created by vhostplugin
# Note: change coremask to suit your system
testpmd \
    -d librte_pmd_virtio.so.17.11 \
    -m 1024 \
    -c 0xC \
    --file-prefix=testpmd_ \
    --vdev=net_virtio_user0,path=/vhu/${ID}/${ID:0:12}-net1 \
    --vdev=net_virtio_user1,path=/vhu/${ID}/${ID:0:12}-net2 \
    --no-pci \
    -- \
    --no-lsc-interrupt \
    --auto-start \
    --tx-first \
    --stats-period 1 \
    --disable-hw-vlan;
```

If packets are not going through, you may need to configure direct flows to your
switch between the used ports. For example, with OVS as the switch, this is done
by getting the port numbers with `ovs-ofctl dump-ports br0` and configuring
flow, for example, from port 1 to port 2 with
`ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 in_port=1,action=output:2` and vice versa.
